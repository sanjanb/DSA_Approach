### **Explanation of the Code**  
This function calculates the Hamming weight (the number of 1's in the binary representation of an integer) using **Brian Kernighan's Algorithm**. This method is very efficient because it only iterates as many times as there are 1's in the number.

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        ans = 0                    # Initialize counter for the number of 1's
        
        while n != 0:              # Continue until all bits are processed (n becomes 0)
            n = n & (n - 1)        # Remove the rightmost set bit (1) from n
            ans += 1               # Increment the counter
        
        return ans                 # Return the total count of 1's
```

1. **Initialization:**  
   - `ans` is set to 0 to count the number of 1's.

2. **While Loop:**  
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is not 0.
   - Inside the loop, the operation `n = n & (n - 1)` clears the least significant bit that is set to 1. This is because subtracting 1 from `n` flips all bits after (and including) the rightmost 1, and when you perform a bitwise AND, it effectively removes that 1.
   - `ans` is incremented each time a 1 is removed.

3. **Return Statement:**  
   - Once `n` becomes 0 (meaning no more 1's remain), the function returns `ans`, which is the Hamming weight.

### **How It Works**
- **Bit Manipulation:**  
  The key operation `n & (n - 1)` leverages a property of binary numbers. For any number `n`, subtracting 1 flips the bits up to and including the rightmost 1. The bitwise AND with `n` then removes that 1, reducing the count of set bits.
  
- **Efficiency:**  
  Instead of iterating through all bits (which would be O(k) where k is the number of bits), this algorithm only iterates as many times as there are 1's in `n`. In the worst-case scenario (when all bits are 1), it still performs significantly fewer iterations.

### **Example Walkthrough**
Consider `n = 13`. In binary, 13 is represented as `1101`.

- **Iteration 1:**  
  - `n = 1101` (binary for 13)  
  - `n - 1 = 1100` (binary for 12)  
  - `n & (n - 1) = 1101 & 1100 = 1100` (binary for 12)  
  - `ans` becomes 1.

- **Iteration 2:**  
  - `n = 1100` (binary for 12)  
  - `n - 1 = 1011` (binary for 11)  
  - `n & (n - 1) = 1100 & 1011 = 1000` (binary for 8)  
  - `ans` becomes 2.

- **Iteration 3:**  
  - `n = 1000` (binary for 8)  
  - `n - 1 = 0111` (binary for 7)  
  - `n & (n - 1) = 1000 & 0111 = 0000`  
  - `ans` becomes 3.
  
The loop ends because `n` is now 0, and the function returns `3`.

### **Time & Space Complexity**
- **Time Complexity:**  
  O(m), where m is the number of 1's in the binary representation of `n`. In the worst case (all bits are 1), this is O(k) for a k-bit integer.
  
- **Space Complexity:**  
  O(1) since the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.

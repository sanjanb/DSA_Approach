### **Missing Number**  
This function finds the missing number from a sequence of distinct numbers ranging from 0 to *n* (where *n* is the length of the array). It does so using a brute force approach by checking for each number in the range [0, n] whether it exists in the input list `nums`.

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)  # Get the number of elements in the array.
        
        for i in range(n + 1):  # Loop through all possible numbers from 0 to n.
            found = False     # Initialize a flag to check if the number i is found in nums.
            
            for j in range(n):  # Loop through each element in the array.
                if nums[j] == i:   # Check if the current element equals i.
                    found = True   # If found, set the flag to True.
                    break          # Exit the inner loop as we don't need to check further.
                    
            if not found:  # After checking all elements, if i was not found,
                return i   # then i is the missing number, so return it.
```

### **How It Works**
1. **Determine the Range to Check:**  
   - Calculate `n`, the length of `nums`.  
   - Since the numbers are supposed to be from 0 to *n*, iterate `i` over `range(n + 1)` (this includes 0 through n).

2. **Search for Each Number:**  
   - For each number `i`, initialize a flag `found` as `False`.  
   - Use an inner loop to check every element in `nums` to see if it matches `i`.  
   - If a match is found, set `found` to `True` and break out of the inner loop.

3. **Identify and Return the Missing Number:**  
   - If, after the inner loop, `found` remains `False`, it means `i` is not present in `nums`.  
   - The function then immediately returns `i` as the missing number.

### **Example Walkthrough**
#### **Input:**
```python
nums = [3, 0, 1]
```
- **n = 3** (there are 3 numbers in the list)
- **Numbers to Check:** 0, 1, 2, 3

| Step | i  | Inner Loop Checks            | Found? | Action         |
|------|----|------------------------------|--------|----------------|
| 1    | 0  | Check: 3, 0, 1 â†’ 0 is found   | True   | Continue loop  |
| 2    | 1  | Check: 3, 0, 1 â†’ 1 is found   | True   | Continue loop  |
| 3    | 2  | Check: 3, 0, 1 â†’ 2 is not found | False  | Return 2       |

#### **Output:**
```python
2
```
(Since the number `2` is missing from the list.)

### **Time & Space Complexity**
- **Time Complexity:**  
  - **O(nÂ²)** in the worst case, because for each of the n+1 numbers, it iterates over the list of n elements.
  
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - **O(1)** since only a few extra variables (`n` and `found`) are used, regardless of the input size.

This brute force approach guarantees that the missing number will be found by checking every possible candidate, though it is not optimal for very large inputs. Would you like to see more optimized solutions or further clarifications? ðŸš€

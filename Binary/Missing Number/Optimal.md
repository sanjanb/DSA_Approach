### **Missing Number**

This solution finds the missing number in an array containing *n* distinct numbers ranging from 0 to *n*. It leverages the mathematical formula for the sum of the first *n* natural numbers.

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
```python
class Solution(object):
    def missingNumber(self, nums):
        n = len(nums)                         # Determine the number of elements in nums.
        actual_sum = sum(nums)                # Compute the sum of all elements present in nums.
        expected_sum = (n * (n + 1)) // 2       # Compute the expected sum of numbers from 0 to n using the formula.
        return expected_sum - actual_sum      # The missing number is the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum.
```

1. **Calculate `n`:**  
   - `n = len(nums)` gets the number of elements in the array.  
   - Since the array is supposed to contain numbers from 0 to *n*, there are *n+1* numbers in total.  

2. **Compute the Actual Sum:**  
   - `actual_sum = sum(nums)` computes the total of all numbers in the array.

3. **Compute the Expected Sum:**  
   - The formula for the sum of the first *n* natural numbers (including 0 to *n*) is given by:  
     \[
     \text{expected\_sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - Here, `(n * (n + 1)) // 2` uses integer division to calculate the expected sum of numbers from 0 to *n*.

4. **Determine the Missing Number:**  
   - The missing number is the difference between the expected sum and the actual sum:
     \[
     \text{missing number} = \text{expected\_sum} - \text{actual\_sum}
     \]
   - If a number is missing, the actual sum will be less than the expected sum by exactly that missing number.

### **How It Works**
- **Example:**  
  Suppose `nums = [3, 0, 1]`.  
  - **n = 3** (there are 3 numbers in the list)  
  - **Actual Sum:** `3 + 0 + 1 = 4`  
  - **Expected Sum:** \((3 * (3 + 1)) // 2 = (3 * 4) // 2 = 12 // 2 = 6\)  
  - **Missing Number:** `6 - 4 = 2`  
  So, the missing number is `2`.

### **Time & Space Complexity**
- **Time Complexity:**  
  - **O(n)** because it takes linear time to compute the sum of the array.
  
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - **O(1)** as it uses a constant amount of extra space.

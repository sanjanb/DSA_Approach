### **Explanation of the Code**  
This function groups anagrams from a list of strings. Anagrams are words that have the same characters but in a different order. The approach uses a dictionary to map a **signature** (or key) that represents the frequency of characters in each string to a list of strings sharing that signature.

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**
```python
def groupAnagrams(strs):
    res = {}                              # Initialize an empty dictionary to store grouped anagrams.
    for s in strs:                        # Loop through each string in the input list.
        count = [0] * 26                  # Create a list of 26 zeros for counting letters 'a' to 'z'.
        for c in s:                       # Loop through each character in the string.
            count[ord(c) - ord("a")] += 1  # Increment the count for the corresponding letter.
        key = tuple(count)                # Convert the count list to a tuple so it can be used as a dictionary key.
        if key in res:                    # If the key already exists in the dictionary,
            res[key].append(s)            # append the current string to the list.
        else:                             # If the key does not exist,
            res[key] = [s]                # create a new entry with the string as the first element in the list.
    
    return list(res.values())             # Return a list of all grouped anagrams.
```

### **How It Works**
1. **Dictionary Initialization:**  
   - `res = {}` creates an empty dictionary that will store keys representing character counts and values as lists of strings that match that count.

2. **Character Count for Each String:**  
   - For every string `s` in `strs`, a list `count` of 26 zeros is created.  
   - The inner loop iterates over each character `c` in the string, using `ord(c) - ord("a")` to determine the correct index (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.) and incrementing the corresponding count.

3. **Creating a Key:**  
   - The `count` list is converted to a tuple (`key = tuple(count)`) to serve as a hashable key in the dictionary.  
   - This key uniquely represents the frequency of each letter in the string.

4. **Grouping Anagrams:**  
   - If the key exists in the dictionary `res`, the string is appended to the list associated with that key.  
   - Otherwise, a new key-value pair is created with the string in a new list.

5. **Returning the Result:**  
   - Finally, `list(res.values())` returns all the groups of anagrams as a list of lists.

### **Example Walkthrough**
Suppose `strs = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]`.

- **For "eat":**  
  - The `count` list becomes something like `[1, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, 0, ...]` (1 for 'e', 1 for 'a', 1 for 't').  
  - Converted to a tuple key, e.g., `(1, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, 0, ...)`.  
  - The dictionary now has: `{(1, 0, 0, ..., 1, 1, 0, ...): ["eat"]}`.

- **For "tea":**  
  - The key generated is the same as for "eat".  
  - "tea" is appended to the list: `{key: ["eat", "tea"]}`.

- **For "tan":**  
  - A different key is generated for "tan" due to different letter frequencies.  
  - The dictionary now includes: `{key1: ["eat", "tea"], key2: ["tan"]}`.

- **Continuing for "ate", "nat", "bat":**  
  - "ate" groups with "eat" and "tea", "nat" groups with "tan", and "bat" forms its own group.

**Output:**  
```python
[["eat", "tea", "ate"], ["tan", "nat"], ["bat"]]
```

### **Time & Space Complexity**
- **Time Complexity:**  
  - O(m * n) where *m* is the average length of the strings and *n* is the number of strings. Each string is processed to count its characters.
  
- **Space Complexity:**  
  - O(n * k) where *k* is the size of the key (in this case, 26 integers) for each string stored in the dictionary.

This solution efficiently groups anagrams by transforming each string into a frequency signature and using that signature as a key for grouping. Would you like further clarifications or more details on any part of this solution? ðŸš€

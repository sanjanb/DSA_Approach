## Step-by-Step Preparation Guide

### Phase 1: Building a Strong Foundation

- **Focus:** Solve easy problems across all topics.
- **Goals:**
  - Develop a solid understanding of fundamental data structures.
  - Learn to traverse different data structures through code.
  - Master the Brute Force Approach.
- **Duration:** 1-2 months
- **Recommendation:** Complete 10-15 problems from each data structure before moving to the next stage.

> **Tip:** Consistency is key. Aim to solve at least one problem per day.

### Phase 2: Tackling Medium Difficulty

- **Focus:** Solve common algorithmic patterns such as Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Fast and Slow Pointers, Merge Intervals, Cyclic Sort, and more.
- **Goals:**
  - Optimize solutions by improving time and space complexity.
  - Learn to analyze and compare different approaches.
- **Duration:** 2-3 months
- **Recommendation:** Complete 5-6 problems from each pattern before moving to hard problems. Solve at least 80-120 problems in total.

> **Tip:** Use a notebook to jot down different approaches and their complexities.

### Phase 3: Conquering Hard Problems

- **Focus:** Strengthen your foundation with medium difficulty problems before moving to hard ones.
- **Goals:**
  - Review and reinforce your understanding of various algorithmic patterns.
  - Practice solving problems that require combining 2-3 patterns.
  - Develop mathematical intuition and derive equations to optimize approaches.
- **Duration:** 3-4 months
- **Recommendation:** Solve at least 60 hard problems to get comfortable.

> **Tip:** Collaborate with peers to discuss and solve hard problems together.

## Strategies for Effective Problem-Solving

1. **Understand the Problem:** Thoroughly read and understand the problem. Use pen and paper to visualize complex problems.

   ```markdown
   Example: Draw a diagram for a graph problem to visualize nodes and edges.
   ```

2. **Brainstorm Approaches:** Spend time brainstorming multiple approaches, analyzing time and space complexity, and considering trade-offs.

   ```markdown
   Example: List down brute-force, optimized, and heuristic approaches.
   ```

3. **Implement Solution:** Write clean, readable code and handle edge cases.

   ```markdown
   Example: Use meaningful variable names and add comments for clarity.
   ```

4. **Test and Optimize:** Test your code against provided test cases, identify and fix bugs, and look for optimization opportunities.

   ```markdown
   Example: Use assertions to validate your code against expected outputs.
   ```

## Leetcode Strategy

### The Ultimate 7-Step Strategy

1. **Deep Problem Understanding (5â€“10 minutes)**
   - Read the problem statement multiple times.
   - Highlight key points and ask questions about inputs, outputs, and constraints.

2. **Devising a Strategy (10â€“15 minutes)**
   - Identify the problem type and choose the right data structure.
   - Write down possible approaches, starting with brute-force and moving to optimized algorithms.

3. **Breaking Down the Problem (10â€“15 minutes)**
   - Divide the solution into smaller, manageable subtasks.
   - Write pseudo-code for clarity.

4. **Writing Pseudocode (10â€“15 minutes)**
   - Translate the breakdown into structured pseudocode.
   - Ensure each line maps directly to a coding construct.

5. **Coding and Debugging (20â€“30 minutes)**
   - Implement the pseudocode in your chosen language.
   - Debug using intermediate outputs and debugging tools.

6. **Iterative Optimization (15â€“20 minutes)**
   - Analyze the solution's complexity and identify bottlenecks.
   - Transition to a more efficient approach.

7. **Process Review (5â€“10 minutes)**
   - Reflect on the approach and note learnings.
   - Write down similar problems you've solved to build pattern recognition.
